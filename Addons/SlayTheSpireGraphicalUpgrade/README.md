# SlayTheSpireGraphicalUpgrade

- Borderless fullscreen if requested, otherwise windowed.

## Usage

- Install ReShade 6.6.0+ with full add-on support. You have to install ReShade to **javaw.exe (SlayTheSpire/jre/bin/javaw.exe)** as OpenGL.
- Note that the game has to start in windowed mode, otherwise ReShade won't work at all.
- Copy **SlayTheSpireGraphicalUpgrade.addon64** the games folder where **SlayTheSpire/jre/bin/javaw.exe** is (ReShade should be installed in the same folder).

## Compilation
- You can clone [ReShade](https://github.com/crosire/reshade) and add SlayTheSpireGraphicalUpgrade project to Examples solution, then build the project.
